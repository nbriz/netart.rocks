        <b>research prompt:</b> the electromagnetic spectrum is only one piece of the physical Internet, look into what other physical infrastructure makes up our global network, what is the Internet made of? Where is it physically located? Who owns and operates it? Produce at least one "research receipt" answering some of these questions. Be prepared to discuss your findings in class next week.

        <b>sketch:</b> represent/depict the journey your particular packet took during our Internet Travelogue workshop (similar to the examples shown in class) or create a sketch that responds to a discovery made along the way (similar to the works discussed in class). Be prepared to share your work next week.</span>
        <br><br>
        <b>UPDATE:</b> because we did the Internet Travelog together in class we'll no longer be doing these for homework (although you of course welcome to keep working on it, please share them with me if you decide to do so). Instead, for homework this week look into Ingrid Burrington's work. Ingrid is an artist, writer and all-around Internet infrastructure expert who will be (virtually) visiting us next week. Additionally, take some time to dive deeper into the <a href="/saic/post-net/the-net.html#extra-research" target="_blank">Extra Research</a> section at the bottom of the class notes on the Internet. Whether it's the history, infrastructure, or politics of the Internet, choose whichever aspect[s] of this conversation you find most interesting and learn a little more about it. Take note of any interesting observations you make or questions you have for our conversation with Ingrid Burrington next week.
        <br><br>
        Before you come to class next week, create a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CreateAccount" target="_blank">wikipedia account</a> and then read pages 7-10 of the <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cf/AFQuickGuideforEditingWikipedia_January2020.pdf" target="_blank">ART+FEMINISM: Quick Guide for Editing on Wikipedia</a>
