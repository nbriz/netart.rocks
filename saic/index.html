            The single most important thing you need in order to have a career in the arts is persistence. The second most important thing you need is talent. The third most important thing is a grounding in how the online world works. Its that Important

        We generally accept that computers and the Internet evolved outside of fine art contexts, in fields like science and mathematics. That said, the history of these technologies is a history of creative individuals collaboratively shaping one of the most important narratives of our time, "the Internet is the great masterpiece of human civilization" (Heffernan). In this studio course, we'll learn what the Internet is, how it works, how it got here and how to engage with it as an artistic medium. This means we'll be learning how to craft it from code, specifically HTML (hypertext markup language) and CSS (cascading style sheets), but also studying its aesthetics, conventions and practices. We'll be drawing inspiration from various internet art movements, from the net.art scene of the 1990s, to the digital folk art of GeoCities at the turn of the century, to the Web design and CSS art scenes of today. The goal of this course will be to cultivate our own piece of internet art, informed by the research, discussions, exercises and experiments we'll make along the way.

        Our particular flavor of the <a href="https://www.saic.edu/academics/departments/academic-spine/professional-practice-experience" target="_blank">Professional Practice Experience</a> will focus on the professional practice of “creative technologists”. This is a term used by various industries (Event Production, Digital/Advertising Agencies, Design Studios, Technology Companies, etc) to describe someone working professionally at the intersection of art and technology. This semester we'll be learning the skills and workflows necessary for success in this field. It's typical for creative technologists to be "generalists", having some background in various creative coding frameworks, creative software (Adobe, Blender, etc) and creative hardware (Microcontrollers, sensors, etc). While the full scope of creative technology is too much to cover in a single course, our focus (Internet/Web based creative projects) is an area of creative technology that encompasses many aspects of the practice.

        The web browser is a blank canvas preinstalled in every kind of Internet connected device (mobile phones, laptops, VR headsets, Raspberry Pi, IoT, etc). Through code we can conjure up within it any kind of preexisting and not yet invented screen based media. The browser is also an art studio, equipped with tools for making hypertext, interactive video, 2D and 3D animation, electronic music, sound sampling and synthesis, mixed reality (AR/VR), artificial intelligence and so much more. This semester we'll learn how to unlock all of the browser's creative potential by learning it's core languages (HTML, CSS and JavaScript) and it's creative APIs. The browser is also a place to share our work, collaborate with others and explore all manner of interesting cultural activity. In this course we will also learn the tools, workflows, conventions and methodologies of professional creative developers by working as an open source arts collective as we collaboratively develop a piece on online artware (software art).
