              There is not a single person in existence who has scanned Facebook’s News Feed and said: <i>Yes, immerse me in this reality. I want to feel my uncle’s meme about Hot Pockets on my face.</i> But “the metaverse” could generate enough momentum, enough knock-on interest, that it could bring this clumsy fantasy framework clattering to life. Which is exactly why this half-real, Big Tech–led effort to erect the metaverse is worth both laughing down and taking seriously.

          I'm obviously <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/8gd79z/nick-briz-how-to-why-leave-facebook-405" target="_blank">biased</a>, but it hurts to see Facebook rebrand itself using a term with an otherwise <a href="http://www.newmediareader.com/book_samples/nmr-26-kay.pdf" target="_blank">inspiriting history</a> in this context. Under <i>Meta's</i> reign, the future of mixed reality is likely to look a lot less like the optimistic visions presented by the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsT59fp8LpY" target="_blank">artists</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKL0urEdtPU" target="_blank">technologists</a> which paved the way, and much more like the <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/v7eqbb/the-metaverse-has-always-been-a-dystopia" target="_blank">dystopian futures</a> articulated by cyberpunk authors.

          Still, it's not a foregone conclusion that a single surveillance capitalist corporation will colonize cyberspace as it has other virtual spaces. As I write this there are loads of artists exploring the emerging technology of virtual reality as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBJPIgNXUDI" target="_blank">a tool</a> as well as an artistic medium, artists like <a href="http://www.lialin.net/" target="_blank">Li Alin</a> or Jordan Wolfson's controversial piece "<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/confronting-the-shocking-virtual-reality-artwork-at-the-whitney-biennial" target="_blank">Real Violence</a>" exhibited at the Whitney Biennial, or this VR Dance piece <a href="https://vimeo.com/210525711" target="_blank">Dust</a> by Mária Júdová and Andrej Boleslavský and this VR immersive dining experience <a href="http://www.mattiacasalegno.net/aerobanquets-rmx/#3" target="_blank">The Aerobanqueets RMX</a> by Mattia Casalegno, just to name a few (for more check out these <a href="https://www.radiancevr.co/" target="_blank">portals</a>, <a href="https://www.creativeapplications.net/?s=VR&submit=Search" target="_blank">publications</a> and <a href="https://dimoda.art/" target="_blank">online</a> and <a href="https://phi-centre.com/en/" target="_blank">offline VR galleries</a>). Like all new technologies, there exists lots of potential promise (consider how VR is being used in society today: from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGGVYT0cMHg" target="_blank">education</a>, to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZStQT3o5xc&feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">surgical training</a>, as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GiJuPB7S2I4" target="_blank">evidence in court cases</a> and for <a href="https://youtu.be/sDc5lIj1VbY?t=731" target="_blank">physical therapy</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMttQHMjbJo" target="_blank">mental health</a>) as well as <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/eye-tracking-vr/" target="_blank">potential peril</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          As artists we need to remain <a href="https://twitter.com/GIFmodel/status/1454919082097225729" target="_blank">critical</a> of the way a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QYqmJsifBjf_xA23Ea7AdeMFyjGWaF_dvhi5EZdNUf4/mobilebasic" target="_blank">toxic corporations like Facebook</a> encroach on this space. We have role to play in both warning society of what this future "metaverse" could become, while also reminding society of all the more interesting and enriching alternative directions this can take. But in order to do that, it would help to learn how to engage with this new medium directly.
        </p>

        <h3>A-Frame</h3>

        <p>
          When Facebook talks about creating the "metaverse", it's talking about throwing fencing around a technology that already exists on the Web as it's done it's entire history, in this instnace we're talking about WebXR (formally WebVR) which is how you create mixed (virtual and augmented) reality "<a href="https://twitter.com/GIFmodel/status/1454919082097225729" target="_blank">experiences</a>" on the Web. The easiest way to get started is probably using the <a href="https://aframe.io/" target="_blank">A-Frame</a> library, which allows you to create 3D/VR environments using custom HTML elements. The library itself is well <a href="https://aframe.io/docs/0.9.0/introduction/" target="_blank">documented</a> but I also have <a href="https://github.com/nbriz/webvr-workshop" target="_blank">notes available from a workshop</a> I've given at various schools in the past.
        </p>

        <p>
          Additionally, there are a few netnet tutorials on  <a href="http://68.183.115.149:8002/?tutorial=webvr-basics" target="_blank">cyberspace</a>, the first tutorial covers some of the fundamental concepts associated with the medium as well as the history of it's development and the various ways artists have engaged with it over the years, while subsequent tutorials cover the craft, specifically how to <a href="http://68.183.115.149:8002/?tutorial=webvr-basics" target="_blank">create a scene</a>, <a href="http://68.183.115.149:8002//?tutorial=webvr-assets" target="_blank">working with assets</a> and ends with <a href="http://68.183.115.149:8002/?tutorial=webvr-outro" target="_blank">a review</a>, but <b>BE WARNED</b>, this is an older version of netnet (BETA-1.0), it doesn't have the same features/feel as the version you're used to (and is likely very buggy).
        </p>

        <h3>Three.js</h3>

        <p>
          A-Frame is build on top of another very popular library called <a href="https://threejs.org/" target="_blank">Three.js</a>, a JavaScript library for creating 3D work on the Web. This is something <a href="https://netizen.org/classes/netart2/notes/threejs/" target="_blank">I cover a little bit</a> in the Internet Art 2 course, but ultimately requires you know how to code in JavaScript as well as some familiarity with Object Oriented Programming. A while back <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yk1bWT8ulA" target="_blank">I created an online platform</a> for experimenting with the library called <a href="http://threejsplaygnd.brangerbriz.net/" target="_blank">the three.js_playGnd</a> without having to learn too much JavaScript first. Sadly that platform is now a bit outdated, but there are loads of other (newer) tutorials out there, my favorite these days is <a href="https://threejs-journey.com/" target="_blank">this online course</a>.
