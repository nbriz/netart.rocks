          Professional Practice Learning Goal #1 requires a "Faculty-Defined Creative Project" that implements a “well-planned creative project, applying professional skills relevant to their artistic, creative, and/or scholarly practice.” This semester we’ll learn how to work as an open source arts collective by collaborating on an Internet "artware" (or software art) project. Creative technologists often work in groups/teams and so there exist industry standard tools and methodologies for how to efficiently work on shared code bases. While working together on this collaborative project we’ll learn the conventions, processes and tools most commonly used in professional software development contexts.

      <p>
        By the middle of the semester everyone should have a GitHub portfolio with at least two (if not more) examples of their web based creative coding work (see the <a href="portfolio.html">creative code portfolio</a> narrative page). GitHub (and other sites like it, including <a href="https://bitbucket.org/" target="_blank">Bitbucket</a> and various <a href="https://gitlab.com/" target="_blank">GitLab</a> instances) are built on top of the software versioning tool called <a href="https://git-scm.com/" target="_blank">git</a>, which, in addition to helping manage the changes and variations of your personal projects, is specifically designed for enabling large groups of developers to collaborate on a shared code base. During the second half of the semester we will learn exactly how this process works by making "contributions" to an open source class project: <a href="#" target="_blank">an experimental online drawing app.</a>
      </p>

      <p>
        You will be expected to complete at least two (if not more) contributions to the class project, these assignments will take the form of self-assigned "tasks" or peer generated "issues" on our class GitHub repository. There are different types of "tasks" you can work on, which will vary in terms of their technical difficulty:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><a href="#" target="_blank">tool module</a></li>
        <li><a href="#" target="_blank">filter module</a></li>
        <li><a href="#" target="_blank">options module</a></li>
        <li><a href="#" target="_blank">function module</a></li>
        <li><a href="#" target="_blank">bug fix</a></li>
        <li><a href="#" target="_blank">enhancement</a></li>
        <li><a href="#" target="_blank">meta task</a></li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The vast majority of the tasks will be “module” contributions, these will be either additional tools, filters, options or functions (the details for each will be explained in class). These tasks will be initially discussed/proposed in a class discussion and, after receiving some feedback on the idea, will be created and self-assigned by the individual artist working on that task.
      </p>

      <p>
        A “meta task” is an idea that goes beyond the constraints of a module, this could mean making modifications to the framework itself like design changes, architectural changes or otherwise extending the functionality beyond what it’s capable of. These tasks will be created by the individual artist but must be pre-approved by the professor before it can be self-assigned.
      </p>

      <p>
        The remaining categories are not necessarily created by the artist planning on working on it, but rather by the professor or someone else in the class. A "bug fix", as the name implies, is an issue created by anyone who notices something wrong with the app. Anyone else who thinks they might be able to fix that bug can assign that task to themselves. Similarly, an "enhancement" is a request created by anyone in the class for a feature not yet included in the app (or the framework) but that they might want to see included in it. Anyone interested in trying to create the feature requested can take that on and assign that task to themselves.
