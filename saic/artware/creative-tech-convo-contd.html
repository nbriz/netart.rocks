        Hi Nick and Nimrod!
        <br><br>
        I wanted to say I really appreciated the conversation in class today! It was really helpful to hear about installation work because this is something I would be interested in– I view it as the design of spaces and I will look further into this.
        <br><br>
        If possible I would love to hear more about different fields where you've worked with graphic designers so I can be exposed to more possibilities. In VISCOM they only expose us to graphic design agencies but I am eager to hear about the different possibilities where creative technology/design can be implemented and how to get to those projects, I would appreciate hearing how more you went about getting a position at the Miami music festival, or at the children's museum if possible! Thank you for sharing your knowledge and experience with us!
        <br><br>
        Best Wishes,<br>

        Hey Miran,
        <br><br>
        Thanks for your email. As you addressing both of us let me just say what I’m writing here is coming plainly out of my own experience which is also mostly in a different country. When I worked on making installations it was usually designed by someone else (e.g <a href="https://sagmeisterwalsh.com/" target="_blank">Sagmeister & Walsch</a>). In museums exhibitions there are many people involved with how things are set up (the ’design of space’) which include the curator, exhibition designer, different fabricators and others. When I worked with museums I was in charge of actually building or implementing a couple of exhibits. The work itself in terms of content and form, as well as how its situated and positioned in space, were given. There’s obviously a spectrum here depending on the specific circumstances.
        <br><br>
        As for how to get these, I’m afraid I don’t have much more than cliches to share: Make work and share it, make friends, reach out to people, build a community...
        <br><br>
        Best of luck,<br>
        —<br>

        Hey Miran,
        <br><br>
        glad to hear u found it helpful! happy to discuss this more during 1-on-1 meetings this week, but for now, here are some (long) answers to ur questions:
        <br><br>
        <i>
          It was really helpful to hear about installation work because this is something I would be interested in– I view it as the design of spaces and I will look further into this.
        </i>
        <br><br>
        For more insight into these sorts of "creative technology" installations <a href="https://laserpilot.medium.com/advice-for-creative-technologists-21f3f220b2" target="_blank">check out this post by Blair Neal</a> who was the Chief Creative Technologist at Fake Love. Unfortunately Fake Love's not around anymore, but they were a creative technology agency based in NYC (similar to the Chicago agencies I mentioned in class, <a href="https://www.lvthn.com/" target="_blank">Leviathan</a> and <a href="https://www.thisisdk.com/" target="_blank">Digital Kitchen</a>). They worked on these sorts of installations before they got bought by the New York Times &amp;&amp; eventually turned into their internal creative tech team. Like i mentioned, sometimes larger companies like these have their own internal teams, it's not common for a newspaper though (NYT is a bit of an exception), in-house creative tech teams are more common at large technology companies like Google's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0bvTBny66o" target="_blank">Creative Lab</a> or larger Ad Agencies like <a href="https://wearebarbarian.com/" target="_blank">the Barbarian Group</a> (whose creative technologists all have their own new media art practices)

        Nimrod is 100% percent right && summed it up quite nicely: <b>"Make work and share it, make friends, reach out to people, build a community..."</b> << but i'll expand on that a bit to help make it more concrete.
        <br><br>
        <b>"Make work and share it,"</b> Most of my commercial projects I've gotten b/c folks have seen work i've done in my personal practice && have then asked if i could make stuff for them. For example, I just had a meeting today w/a former client i created <a href="http://emiliovavarella.com/othershapes/" target="_blank">a custom app for which converts his DNA data into textiles</a>. We had no prior connection, he just saw some of my glitch art stuff online && reached out. Other times it's even been a recommendation of someone who came across my stuff online, for example <a href="http://nickbriz.work/?portfolio=Muse-AI-Supercuts" target="_blank">this algorithmically generated series of music videos</a> we (myself && <a href="https://brannondorsey.com/" target="_blank">Brannon Dorsey</a>) made for the British band Muse. Brannon && I had been doing some <a href="https://brangerbriz.com/blog/perspective-on-creative-ai" target="_blank">AI research && sharing it online</a>. The band's record label (Warner Music UK) had reached out to an AI artist named <a href="https://genekogan.com/" target="_blank">Gene Kogan</a> (who i don't know personally, but whose work i follow online), Gene didn't have time to take on the project, but he had seen the stuff we had been sharing && so he recommended Warner reach out to us.
        <br><br>
        But more often than that, the projects usually come from my network, like Nimrod said <b>"make friends, reach out to people, build a community"</b>. Sometimes it's a direct connection, for example, one of my long time art collaborators (who i met in grad school) <a target="_blank" href="https://jonsatrom.com/">jon.satrom</a> also does a lot of commercial work under his LLC <a target="_blank" href="https://studiothread.com/">studiothread</a>, && so when he needs some extra help on projects he often times reaches out to me. Other times it's a bit more indirect, for example i did some consulting for the <a target="_blank" href="https://smartmuseum.uchicago.edu/">Smart Museum</a> couple years ago, which came via a recommendation from the designers they were working with, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sonnenzimmer.com/">Sonnenzimmer</a>, who I met a couple years prior through a curator, <a target="_blank" href="https://mcachicago.org/About/Who-We-Are/Friends/Christy-Le-Master">Christy Le Master</a>, which I met when i first moved to Chicago when i submitted some student work to show at her microcinema (aka apartment gallery) called <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nightingalecinema.org/">the Nightingale</a> (which after 10 years is sadly throwing their final Farewell Festival this weekend).
        <br><br>
        On larger installations I often work w/a team, sometimes i'll assemble a small group together (usually other friends/artists i've worked w/in the past) but most often i've worked with my cousin Paul Briz && friend Ramon Branger who run a digital agency called <a target="_blank" href="https://brangerbriz.com/">Branger_Briz</a> (with whom i've also worked on various art projects, like we explained in class, there's often a lot of overlap between the personal + commercial practices). Paul && i are really good at making stuff, but not so good at "networking", Ramon on the other hand is amazing at networking. He first got started working at a now defunct ad agency called the Alten Group in Miami. While working there he made lots of connections w/folks at other agencies they worked with && brands they worked for. When the Alten Group went under he started his own thing w/my cousin Paul && initially just cold called + setup meetings w/all the folks he had met while working at the Alten Group. Eventually some of those meetings turned into projects && some of those projects turned into recurring clients.

        <i>I would appreciate hearing how more you went about getting a position at the Miami music festival, or at the children's museum if possible! Thank you for sharing your knowledge and experience with us!</i>
        <br><br>
        Both these projects were Branger_Briz projects. The music festival was an installation was for <a target="_blank" href="https://www.iiipoints.com/">iii points</a>, the client was a Mezcal company called <a target="_blank" href="https://www.zignummezcal.com/">Zignum</a> which was one of the festival sponsors. <a target="_blank" href="https://brangerbriz.com/portfolio/zignum-spirit-animals">Here's a short case study page</a>, there's a video && some images. We'd been working w/Zignum since they first launched the brand. I can't remember how we first got in contact w/them though (likely a recommendation from another client). I played more of a "creative director" role on this project (did very minimal design/coding myself, mostly directed folks, helped debug && assembled all the pieces). We worked w/a design agency called <a target="_blank" href="http://www.maciascreative.com/">Macias Creative</a> (which we have a long+tight relationship with) to concept it && to do all the graphic design work (UI, textures, etc). Then we worked w/another agency to create the 3D models which we've also got a long standing relationship w/called <a target="_blank" href="https://d10studio.com.mx/">D10</a>. We tried a few diff technology stacks before settling on Unity to build it out. I hate working in Unity, so i sub-contracted <a target="_blank" href="https://chriscollins.online/">Chris Collins</a> (who teaches <a target="_blank" href="https://www.saic.edu/profiles/faculty/christopher-lee-collins">New Media courses at SAIC</a>, maybe u know him?) to do all the Unity bits. I put it all together in my studio in Chicago, && then worked w/my cousin && folks at Macias in Miami to actually do the physical setup on-site.
        <br><br>
        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.miamichildrensmuseum.org/">The Children's museum</a> is a client we've produced numerous installations for over the years. <a target="_blank" href="https://brangerbriz.com/portfolio/interactive-mural-miami-childrens-museum">Case study page for that one's not great</a> (we shoulda done a better job documenting it) but there are a couple pics on there (easier to see on desktop). Like Zignum, they probably reached out to us via a reference from another former client (that or Ramon cold called them at some point) && after that first installation went well, they kept coming back to us every time they needed something new like that. This one we did all ourselves (no sub-contractors). Like the Zignum installation, we scoped out the hardware && purchased what we needed (in this case it was a touchscreen table, a second larger screen for the "canvas" && then a PC we built which could handle the app). The UI for this one was fairly easy, so i designed it myself && then built the app in HTML/CSS && JavaScript (even though these languages are typically used to build websites, u can also use them to create applications for installations... but that's something outside the scope of what tools like WebFlow make possible, for this one we used a framework called <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/">Electron</a>). Brannon (who i also worked on the Muse project with, he was a former student who interned w/me && then started working w/us afterwards) worked on training the AI style transfer models && implementing them into the app. Then Paul handled the physical install w/help from the museum's fabricators.
        <br><br>
        ...oooof, that's a long email... hopefully it helps paint the bigger picture a bit more though!
