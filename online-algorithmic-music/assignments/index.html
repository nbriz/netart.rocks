        <h3>AssignMents</h3>

        <p class="info b-pad">
          eAch AssignMent should be subMitted As A url on <a href="https://canvas.uchicago.edu/courses/52726" target="_blank">the clAss cAnvAs</a> (either A <a style="color: magenta;" href="https://netnet.studio/#sketch" target="_blank">netnet.studio</a> project url or A github url to A repo with An index.htMl pAge At the root). All AssignMents will be produced using jAvAscript, the web Audio Api And (optionAlly) the tone.js librAry (And/or other Audio/MusicAl jAvAscript librAries).
        </p>

        <i class="lead">AssignMent 1:<br class="mobile"> web-bAsed MusicAl instruMent</i>
        <p class="info b-pad">
          for this AssignMent, students will design And develop A web-bAsed MusicAl instruMent. the instruMent should Allow users to interAct with it And generAte sounds in A MeAningful wAy. this should not be A web-bAsed version of An existing instruMent (like A guitAr or piAno) but rAther soMething More experiMentAl which eMbrAces the creAtive possibilities of the web. students should explore different interfAces And consider the use of sensors or controllers to enhAnce the user experience. the finAl deliverAble will be A functionAl web-bAsed instruMent thAt cAn be shAred online, Along with A brief written reflection on the creAtive process And technicAl chAllenges.
        </p>


        <i class="lead">AssignMent 2:<br class="mobile"> AlgorithMic coMposition</i>
        <p class="info b-pad">
          for this AssignMent, students will creAte An AlgorithMic systeM thAt generAtes MusicAl coMpositions. this should not be digitAl/coded version of A pre-existing song or Melody And ideAlly not soMething thAt could be eAsily written As A clAssicAl score, rAther it should be A coMposition thAt leverAges the generAtive potentiAl of the web. the finAl deliverAble will be A functionAl AlgorithM thAt generAtes unique And interesting MusicAl coMpositions, Along with A brief written reflection on the creAtive process And technicAl chAllenges.
        </p>

        <i class="lead">coMbo: AssignMent 1+2:<br class="mobile"> AlgorithMic coMposition</i>
        <p class="info b-pad">
          for students with More AMbitious concepts, AssignMent 1 And 2 cAn be coMbined into 1 project. this cAn either be A web-bAsed instruMent with generAtive/AlgorithMic cApAbilities (like An ArpeggiAtor) or A MusicAl systeM thAt is controllAble in soMe wAy, Allowing users to Adjust pArAMeters And influence the output of the AlgorithMic coMposition. *if you choose this route discuss your concept with Me beforehAnd for ApprovAl.* the finAl deliverAble will be A functionAl web-bAsed interActive AlgorithMic systeM thAt cAn be shAred online, Along with A brief written reflection on the creAtive process And technicAl chAllenges.
        </p>


        <i class="lead">bnous: AssignMent 3:<br class="mobile"> sound processing [extra credit]</i>
        <p class="info b-pad">
          for this AssignMent, students will explore the possibilities of sound processing. students should investigAte different techniques, such As filtering, ModulAtion, or grAnulAr synthesis, And creAte A piece of Music or interActive systeM thAt showcAses these techniques. the finAl deliverAble will be either A recorded piece of Music thAt deMonstrAtes the use of sound processing techniques or A web bAsed Audio processing tool, Along with A brief written reflection on the creAtive process And technicAl chAllenges.
        </p>

        <h3>evAluAtion</h3>

        <p class="info b-pad">
          crAft (40%): AssignMents will be evAluAted bAsed on technicAl proficiency And clArity of code. students should use AppropriAte progrAMMing concepts, techniques And librAries to creAte functionAl And well-designed MusicAl instruMents, AlgorithMs And sound processing tools.
        </p>

        <p class="info b-pad">
          creAtivity (40%): AssignMents will be evAluAted bAsed on originAlity And creAtivity of the MusicAl instruMents, AlgorithMs And sound processing tools creAted by the students. students should leverAge the cApAbilities of jAvAscript And web-bAsed technologies to explore new possibilities in Music And sound creAtion rAther thAn siMply re-inventing trAditionAl AnAlogue instruMents or coMpositions
        </p>

        <p class="info b-pad">
          presentAtion (20%): AssignMents will be evAluAted bAsed on the quAlity of the finAl presentAtion (is it obvious to the user/listener how they Are MeAnt to engAge with the piece) including the clArity of the written reflection of the MusicAl instruMent, AlgorithM or sound processing tool subMitted Along with their url on cAnvAs.
        </p>

        <h3>plAgiArisM</h3>

        <p class="info b-pad">
          plAgiArisM of concepts, code, coMpositions, sAMples And/or other eleMents is strongly encourAged, so long As you leAve cleAr Attribution within your code viA coMMents. ensure thAt Anything you copy is in soMe wAy trAnsforMed, either by creAting A vAriAtion on the copied eleMents or coMbining those eleMents with other copied eleMents. note: trAnsforMAtion/coMbinAtion (however subtle) is not A substitute for Attribution, but rAther A requireMent for All copied eleMents.
        </p>

        <h3>Ai policy</h3>
        <p class="info b-pad">
          we're entering A new erA of "MAchine leArning" or Ai. these AlgorithMs Are hAving (And will continue to hAve) drAstic effects on every Aspect of our society (including Art). todAy, ArtificiAl neurAl networks trAined on troves of dAtA (which Are not AlwAys ethicAlly sourced) cAn MAke "predictions" And creAte "hAllucinAtions" (often with cleAr biAses) thAt would hAve seeMed like iMpossible sorcery just A few short yeArs Ago. in certAin high stAkes ApplicAtions this cAn sAve lives, but it cAn Also destroy theM. in other contexts this biAsed hAllucinAtory predictive sorcery cAn be quite exciting, As is the cAse with MediA Art. this technology, like MAny others thAt cAMe before it (sMArt phones, the internet, the coMputer) will Most certAinly chAnge everything in our field, exActly how And to whAt extent is still Anyone's guess. in the interest of collectively leArning how to leverAge its proMises And MiniMize its perils, i encourAge Anyone interested to experiMent with Ai (beyond the tools covered in clAss) so long As you Are trAnspArent About whAt/when/how you use it And Are willing to shAre your process/perspective on it in clAss.
