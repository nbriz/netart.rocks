        <p>The Internet is the great masterpiece of human civilization. As an artifact it challenges the pyramid, the aqueduct, the highway, the novel, the newspaper, the nation-state, the Magna Carta, Easter Island, Stonehenge, agriculture, the feature film, the automobile, the telephone, the telegraph, the television, the Chanel suit, the airplane, the pencil, the book, the printing press, the radio, the realist painting, the abstract painting, the Pill, the washing machine, the skyscraper, the elevator, and cooked meat. As an idea it rivals monotheism</p>

        Throughout this semester we will be exploring and experimenting with Internet art through the lenses of different online cultural niches; each community having different goals and perspectives, each celebrating their own masterpieces, like net.artist Olia Lialina's <a href="https://anthology.rhizome.org/my-boyfriend-came-back-from-the-war" target="_blank">My Boyfriend Came Back From the War</a>, digital folklore enthusiast Cameron Askin's <a href="https://www.cameronsworld.net/" target="_blank">homage to GeoCities</a> and the <a href="https://diana-adrianne.com/purecss-gaze/" target="_blank">CSS Art</a> of cascading stylesheets virtuoso Diana Smith.

        Before we dive into any one of these creative corners of the Internet, it's worth taking a moment to zoom way out and possibly consider the Internet itself as one giant work of art, or as Virginia Heffernan put it, "the great masterpiece of human civilization". In her book Magic and Loss, Heffernan considers the Internet itself as a massive work of art. She explores the logic, aesthetics and values of the Internet as a collective cultural whole. The entire book is worth a read, but we'll just be reading <a href="/files/magic-and-loss.pdf" target="_blank">the Preface</a>.

        In anticipation of our hacking workshop next week, you might consider watching <a href="https://archive.org/details/UnauthorizedAccess" target="_blank">Unauthorized Access</a>, about curious and creative netizens "using new technologies in a way which is not intended." <i>â€”unnamed German hacker</i>. This documentary on hacker culture was produced in 1994 by Annaliza Savage, she traveled to 15 cities in four countries to record the stories of notorious hackers in that era. Not the DIY home-brew tinkier sort of hacker (like the kind you'd find at a Hack-a-thon or maker space) but the "black hoodie" breaking into systems sort of hacker. Though illegal, this was a time before the "<a href="https://www.viceland.com/en_us/show/cyberwar" target="_blank">cyberwar</a>" era we're in now, most of these hackers weren't paid, they weren't after money, they did what they did either for political/activist reasons, or for the challenge, or sometimes just for fun.
