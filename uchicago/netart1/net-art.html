      <h3>when artists discovered HTML</h3>

      <p>
        Complete the <a href="https://netnet.studio/?tutorial=net-art-1" target="_blank">net.art (part 1)</a> tutorial on netnet. In this tutorial we'll be introduced to the net.art movement, who, in the mid 1990s, were among the first artists to migrate their practices over to the new medium of the World Wide Web. We'll also take a close look at the HTML code behind one early piece of net.art by self proclaimed "artivist" (artist + activist), Heath Bunting who was among the first wave of artists to embrace the Web as a space for artistic interventions. His piece <i>King's Cross Phone In</i> (1994), is one of his earliest, and most written about, pieces of "net.art"

        Complete the <a href="https://netnet.studio/?tutorial=net-art-2" target="_blank">net.art (part 2)</a> tutorial on netnet. For many artists, the Web was a means to an end. As we discussed in the last tutorial, for <a href="https://anthology.rhizome.org/communication-creates-conflict" target="_blank">irational.org</a> (Heath Bunting, Kayle Brandon, Rachel Baker, etc.) it was a tool for "hacktivist" intervention, for others like <a href="https://anthology.rhizome.org/brandon" target="_blank">Shu Lea Cheang</a> it was a new means to "explore the construction and perception of identity" (Tribe/Jana) and for others, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_to_Love_You_More" target="_blank">Miranda July and Harrell Fletcher</a> a space to experiment with new forms of collaboration and participatory art. But the Web was also a new medium and for many artists, discovering, and perhaps also defining, what that meant was the most exciting part. What would be the Web's inherent features? it's aesthetics? it's dynamics? it's conventions? tropes? cliches? strengths? weaknesses? In this tutorial we'll look at a couple of different responses to this question by early net artists: jodi.org and "Form Art".
